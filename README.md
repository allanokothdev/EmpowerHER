# EmpowerHER

"EmpowerHer" is a mobile app that facilitates financial inclusion by allowing unbanked women to invest in assets through savings groups. The app is designed specifically for women in Africa, who often face barriers to accessing financial services due to a lack of financial literacy, lack of collateral, and social and cultural norms.

EmpowerHer enables women to join or create savings groups within the app, where they can easily contribute funds and track their investments in real-time. The app also provides education and training on financial management and investing, allowing women to build their financial knowledge and confidence.

One of the key features of the app is that it allows women to invest in tokenized assets, such as stocks, bonds, and real estate, through their savings groups. This provides opportunities for wealth creation and economic empowerment, as well as diversification of the group's investment portfolio.

The app is built on blockchain technology, which ensures transparency, security, and efficiency in managing the group's funds and investments. It also eliminates the need for a trusted third party, such as a bank or financial institution, which can be inaccessible or unaffordable for many women.

Overall, EmpowerHer has the potential to greatly benefit unbanked women in Africa by providing them with a secure, accessible, and empowering platform for investing in assets through savings groups.

# Market Research

Financial exclusion is a significant issue in Kenya, particularly for women. Some statistics that support this include:

Low financial inclusion: According to the World Bank, only 46% of the adult population in Kenya has access to formal financial services, and this figure is even lower for women, with only 38% of adult women having access to financial services.

Gender disparities: In Kenya, women are less likely than men to have access to financial services, such as savings accounts and credit, due to a range of social and cultural barriers, including limited educational and employment opportunities, lower levels of financial literacy, and traditional gender roles that limit their ability to participate in the financial sector.

Low levels of financial literacy: According to the Financial Sector Deepening Kenya (FSD Kenya), only 18% of women in Kenya have basic financial knowledge and are confident in using financial services, compared to 31% of men. This lack of financial literacy and confidence can prevent women from accessing and using financial services and investment opportunities.

Inadequate financial infrastructure: In Kenya, there is limited financial infrastructure in many rural areas, which can make it difficult for people, particularly women, to access financial services and investment opportunities. This lack of infrastructure is a significant barrier to financial inclusion, particularly for women in rural areas.

Limited investment opportunities: In Kenya, many people, particularly women, have limited access to investment opportunities, such as stocks, bonds, and mutual funds, which can help them grow their savings and achieve their financial goals. This lack of investment opportunities can limit the financial growth and stability of women and their families.

These statistics highlight the need for financial services and investment opportunities that are accessible, convenient, and secure, and that cater to the specific needs of unbanked women in Kenya. EmpowerHer can play a critical role in helping to address these issues by providing a platform for women to invest their savings, access financial education, and connect with other women to support each other.

# Target Market

The target market for EmpowerHER is unbanked women in developing countries who are interested in investing their savings to achieve their financial goals. These women may be members of savings groups, or may be interested in joining or creating a savings group to pool their resources and achieve their financial goals.

EmpowerHER is designed specifically for women who are looking for a secure, convenient, and accessible way to invest their savings and achieve their financial goals. The app provides a user-friendly interface and personalized investment recommendations, making it easy for women to invest and manage their savings, even if they have limited financial knowledge or experience.

Additionally, the app's social network component allows women to connect with and support each other, share knowledge and resources, and build a strong community of investors. This helps to overcome the social and cultural barriers that may prevent women from investing and achieving their financial goals.

According to the World Bank, there are approximately 1.7 billion adults globally who lack access to formal financial services and are considered to be unbanked. Of this group, the majority are women.

In developing countries, the number of unbanked women is particularly high, and this is due to a range of factors, including a lack of financial infrastructure, limited access to financial services, and cultural and social barriers that prevent women from participating in the financial sector.
